 ss_coup_event.2.d:0 "As the smoke in the Führer Headquarters cleared, Heinrich Himmler emerged from the chaotic firefight as the sole survivor. According to his testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared him a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realizing that he must choose between his personal honor and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\nHowever in a surprise decision Wehrmacht decided to back Himmler in this perilous time to secure the country's future and to stop a civil war from happening. Now Hitler's mantle belongs to Himmler."

Army units have surrounded a number of government ministeries and attempted to arrest high-ranking officials of the party. Small-scale skirmishes and firefights between SS-guard details and Army detachments have been reported all across Berlin. It appears that the Wehrmacht has demanded that all SS units stand down immediately and hand over the weapons, which SS leadership has refused outright.\n\nBoth factions currently struggle for control of Berlin. Parts of the Wehrmacht have declared their loyalty to [GER.GetLeader] and taken up arms against the rebels. \n\nThe conflagration of this war is only going to spread."
